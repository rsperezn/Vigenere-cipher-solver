I HAVE GIVEN I HAVE GIVEN AND GOT NONE
STILL IM DRIVEN BY SOMETHING I CANT EXPLAIN
ITS NOT A CROSS IT IS A CHOICE
I CANNOT HELP BUT HEAR HIS VOICE
I ONLY WISH THAT I COULD LISTEN WITHOUT SHAME

LET IT RAIN LET IT RAIN ON ME
LET IT RAIN OH LET IT RAIN
LET IT RAIN ON ME

I HAVE BEEN A WITNESS 3434343434 TO THE PERFECT CRIME
WIPE THE GRIN OFF OF MY FACE TO HIDE THE PAIN
IT ISNT WORTH THE TEARS YOU CRY
TO HAVE A PERFECT ALIBI
NOW IM BEATEN AT THE HANDS OF MY OWN GAME

LET IT RAIN LET IT RAIN ON ME
LET IT RAIN OH LET IT RAIN
LET IT RAIN ON ME
